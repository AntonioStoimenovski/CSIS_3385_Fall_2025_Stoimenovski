When I revised the form, the biggest changes I made were making it valid, easier to use, and more
 secure. First, I changed the form method from DELETE to POST because HTML forms only work
 with GET and POST, so the browser could actually send the data correctly. I also fixed all the input
 types like using text for the username, password for the password, number for age, and email for
 email so that the browser can help check the data automatically. I made sure every input had a
 proper <label> with the for attribute so that it’s clear which label belongs to which input, which
 also helps with accessibility.

For validation, I added rules that make sense for each field. For example, the password needs to
 have a minimum and maximum length and at least one letter and one number. The age field has a
 minimum and maximum value. The message field is limited to 10 words using JavaScript, and
 there’s a small live counter so users can see how many words they typed. I also added required to
 fields so the form can’t be submitted incomplete, and used placeholders and autocomplete to make
 it easier to fill out.
